## Welcome to Killawabbit's Pages

My name is Henrik, but you may call me Killwabbit as my developer alias. I live in Gothenburg in Sweden with my betrothed and our two sons. Time and family with kids is precious so things here will have to move slow, but I hope to be able to keep it up without to much time away.

### Development
I'm mainly interested in web development, and I use [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) as CMS which I've done for many years without digging very deep into the possibilities of features it brings for customisation.

So, now my next endeavour is to work with post types, taxonomies and custom fields in Wordpress to make a custom [Simple Media Projects Manager](simple-media-projects-manager.md). It may happen to become a Wordpress plugin development project which I've started researching and tinkering with or just a few code snippets dependent on other projects and/or other plugins. For now I will just assemble links to different resources and reference, while I'm getting towards my understanding of how to do what I intend to accomplish.
